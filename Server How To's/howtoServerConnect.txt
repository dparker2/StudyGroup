2. Open terminal and cd to directory that key-pair file is in.
3. Run this command, this will add it to ssh:
    chmod 400 admin-pair-useast.pem
4. While inside the same folder as the key-pair, run this command to connect to server:
    ssh -i "admin-pair-useast.pem" ec2-user@ec2-18-221-67-202.us-east-2.compute.amazon.aws.com
   -- If you're not in the folder with the key-pair, you can just use the directoy path, i.e. 
    ssh -i ~/FILEPATH/admin-pair-useast.pem ec2-user@ec2-18-221-67-202.us-east-2.compute.amazon.aws.com
